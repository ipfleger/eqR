\title{Compute Statistical Moments from a Frequency Distribution}
\usage{
get_moments(
  scores = NULL,
  freq = NULL,
  rel_freq = NULL,
  min = NULL,
  max = NULL,
  inc = NULL
)
}
\arguments{
\item{scores}{A numeric vector of the score points. If `NULL` (the default),
scores are generated using `min`, `max`, and `inc`.}

\item{freq}{An integer vector of absolute frequencies corresponding to the
scores. Either `freq` or `rel_freq` must be provided.}

\item{rel_freq}{A numeric vector of relative frequencies (proportions).}

\item{min}{A numeric value for the minimum score (used if `scores` is `NULL`).}

\item{max}{A numeric value for the maximum score (used if `scores` is `NULL`).}

\item{inc}{A numeric value for the increment (used if `scores` is `NULL`).}
}
\value{
A named numeric vector containing the mean, standard deviation (sd),
  skewness, and kurtosis.
}
\description{
Computes the first four statistical moments (mean, standard deviation,
skewness, and kurtosis) from a frequency distribution. This function is a
more idiomatic R replacement for the C functions `MomentsFromFD` and
`MomentsFromRFD`.
}
\details{
The function can accept either absolute frequencies (`freq`) or relative
frequencies (`rel_freq`). If `freq` is provided, it will be used to
calculate the total number of observations and then converted to relative
frequencies. If only `rel_freq` is provided, the calculations are based
directly on the proportions.

The `scores` can be provided as a vector. If `scores` is `NULL`, they are
generated as a sequence from `min` to `max` with an increment of `inc`.
