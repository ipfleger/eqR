\title{Calculate the Zero-Based Index of a Score}
\usage{
loc(x, min, inc)
}
\arguments{
\item{x}{A numeric value representing the score.}

\item{min}{A numeric value for the minimum score in the sequence.}

\item{inc}{A numeric value for the increment between scores.}
}
\value{
An integer representing the zero-based index of the score `x`.
}
\description{
This function calculates the location (zero-based index) of a given score
within a sequence of scores defined by a minimum value and a constant
increment. It is an R translation of the `loc` function from the
"Equating Recipes" C code by R. L. Brennan.
}
\details{
The original C code notes that for best results, the input values should be
specified with high precision (e.g., at least eight digits), especially
when the increment is a repeating decimal.

Note that this function returns a **zero-based index** to maintain
consistency with the original C library's logic. R users should be mindful
of this, as R typically uses 1-based indexing. To use this index to subset
a standard R vector, you would need to add 1.

\examples{
# Find the location of the score 16 in a sequence from 10 to 20 by 2.
score_location <- loc(x = 16, min = 10, inc = 2)
print(score_location)
#> [1] 3
