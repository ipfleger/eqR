\title{Perform the DAXPY Operation}
\usage{
er_daxpy(vectY, alpha, vectX)
}
\arguments{
\item{vectY}{A numeric vector (the "y" in the operation).}

\item{alpha}{A single numeric value (the scalar "a").}

\item{vectX}{A numeric vector (the "x" in the operation), which must be the
same length as `vectY`.}
}
\value{
A new numeric vector containing the result of `alpha * vectX + vectY`.
}
\description{
Performs the "DAXPY" (Double-precision A*X Plus Y) operation, a common
routine in basic linear algebra subprograms (BLAS). It computes the
expression `alpha * x + y`.
}
\details{
This is a wrapper around R's standard vectorized arithmetic, which is
highly efficient. The C version (`er_daxpy`) modifies the `y` vector in
place, whereas this R function returns a new vector containing the result,
which is more idiomatic for R.

\examples{
y <- c(10, 20, 30)
x <- c(1, 2, 3)
a <- 2
er_daxpy(y, a, x) # Expected: 2*c(1,2,3) + c(10,20,30) = c(12, 24, 36)
