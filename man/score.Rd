\title{Calculate the Score from a Zero-Based Index}
\usage{
score(loc, min, inc)
}
\arguments{
\item{loc}{An integer representing the zero-based index.}

\item{min}{A numeric value for the minimum score in the sequence.}

\item{inc}{A numeric value for the increment between scores.}
}
\value{
A numeric value representing the score at the given location.
}
\description{
This function calculates the score associated with a given zero-based index
within a sequence defined by a minimum value and a constant increment. It is
the inverse of the `loc()` function. This is an R translation of the `score`
function from the "Equating Recipes" C code by R. L. Brennan.
}
\details{
The original C code notes that for best results, the input values should be
specified with high precision (e.g., at least eight digits).
}
\examples{
# Find the score at the 3rd index (4th position) in a sequence
# starting at 10 with an increment of 2.
the_score <- score(loc = 3, min = 10, inc = 2)
print(the_score)
#> [1] 16
