\title{Solve a System of Linear Equations using LU Decomposition}
\usage{
er_lubksb(a, b)
}
\arguments{
\item{a}{A square numeric matrix (the coefficient matrix).}

\item{b}{A numeric vector or matrix (the right-hand side of the equation).}
}
\value{
A vector or matrix `x` representing the solution to the system.
}
\description{
Solves the linear system `a %*% x = b` for `x`. This function is designed
to work with the output of `er_ludcmp`, mirroring the C library's two-step
process for solving linear systems.
}
\details{
This function is a wrapper for R's built-in `solve()` function, which is
highly optimized and performs LU decomposition with partial pivoting
internally to solve the system. The C version `er_lubksb` performs
forward and backward substitution on an already-decomposed matrix.
}
\examples{
A <- matrix(c(2, 1, -1, -3, -1, 2, -2, 1, 2), nrow = 3, byrow = TRUE)
B <- c(8, -11, -3)
# In C, you would call ludcmp then lubksb. In R, we can combine them.
X <- er_lubksb(A, B)
print(X)
#> [1]  2  3 -1
