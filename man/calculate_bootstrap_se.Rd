\title{Calculate Bootstrap Statistics from Replications}
\usage{
calculate_bootstrap_se(results_matrix, original_freq = NULL)
}
\arguments{
\item{results_matrix}{A matrix where each column is the result from one
bootstrap replication and each row corresponds to a score point.}

\item{original_freq}{(Optional) A vector of original frequencies, used to
calculate the overall weighted standard error.}
}
\value{
A list containing `mean_scores`, `se_scores`, `overall_se`, and
  the 95% confidence interval bounds `ci_95_low` and `ci_95_high`.
}
\description{
Calculates the mean, standard deviation (bootstrap SE), percentile-based
confidence intervals, and overall SE from a matrix of bootstrap results.
This function replaces the C functions `Boot_accumulate_eraw`, `Boot_se_eraw`,
`Boot_accumulate_ess`, and `Boot_se_ess`.
}
\details{
In R, it is more idiomatic to collect all results into a matrix first and
then compute summary statistics, rather than accumulating sums in a loop.
