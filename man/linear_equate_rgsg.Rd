\title{Perform Linear Equating for Random Groups and Single Group Designs}
\usage{
linear_equate_rgsg(mnx, sdx, mny, sdy, mean_only = FALSE, min_x, max_x, inc_x)
}
\arguments{
\item{mnx}{A numeric value, the mean of the new form (X).}

\item{sdx}{A numeric value, the standard deviation of the new form (X).}

\item{mny}{A numeric value, the mean of the old form (Y).}

\item{sdy}{A numeric value, the standard deviation of the old form (Y).}

\item{mean_only}{A logical. If TRUE, mean equating is performed (slope is fixed to 1).
If FALSE (the default), linear equating is performed.}

\item{min_x}{A numeric value, the minimum score on the X scale.}

\item{max_x}{A numeric value, the maximum score on the X scale.}

\item{inc_x}{A numeric value, the increment between scores on the X scale.}
}
\value{
A list containing the slope (`a`), intercept (`b`), and a numeric
  vector of the equated raw scores (`equated_scores`).
}
\description{
Performs linear or mean equating for the Random Groups (RG) and Single Group
(SG) designs. This is an R translation of the `RGandSG_LinEq` function.
}
\details{
The function calculates the slope (`a`) and intercept (`b`) of the linear
transformation `y = a*x + b`. For mean equating, the slope is fixed at 1.
For linear equating, the slope is the ratio of the standard deviations.
It then applies this transformation to a sequence of raw scores.
}
\examples{
# Example data for linear equating
mean_x <- 25; sd_x <- 5
mean_y <- 50; sd_y <- 10
min_score <- 10; max_score <- 40; increment <- 1

result <- linear_equate_rgsg(mean_x, sd_x, mean_y, sd_y, mean_only = FALSE,
                             min_score, max_score, increment)
print(result$a) # Slope should be 10/5 = 2
print(result$b) # Intercept should be 50 - 2*25 = 0
print(head(result$equated_scores))
