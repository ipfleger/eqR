\title{Gaussian Quadrature for Numerical Integration (Final Version)}
\usage{
gaussian_quadrature_vec(f, lower, upper, ...)
}
\arguments{
\item{f}{The function to integrate.}

\item{lower}{The lower limit of integration.}

\item{upper}{The upper limit of integration.}

\item{...}{Catches any additional arguments from the calling function to
ensure signature compatibility. These are not used by this fixed-point method.}
}
\value{
The approximate value of the integral as a single numeric value.
}
\description{
Approximates a definite integral using a 20-point Legendre-Gauss fixed-point
rule. This function is a drop-in replacement for the previous `stats::integrate`
version, designed for speed and vectorization.
