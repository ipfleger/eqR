\usage{
equate_cll(design, ...)
}
\arguments{
\item{design}{A string specifying the equating design. One of "SG" (Single
Group), "CB" (Counter-Balanced), "NEAT_PS" (NEAT Post-Stratification), or
"NEAT_CHN" (NEAT Chained).}

\item{...}{Additional arguments required by the specific design, such as
`bivar1`, `bivar2`, `wts`, etc.}
}
\value{
A vector of equated scores.
}
\description{
This function is a high-level wrapper that performs continuized log-linear
equating for various designs by calling the appropriate helper functions.
It replaces the C functions `Wrapper_SC`, `Wrapper_CC`, and `Wrapper_BC`.
