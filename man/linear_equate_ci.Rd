\usage{
linear_equate_ci(
  mnx1,
  sdx1,
  mnv1,
  sdv1,
  covxv1,
  mny2,
  sdy2,

  mean_only = FALSE,
  type = "all",

)
}
\arguments{
\item{mnx1, sdx1}{Mean and SD of form X for population 1.}

\item{mnv1, sdv1}{Mean and SD of anchor test V for population 1.}

\item{covxv1}{Covariance of X and V for population 1.}

\item{mny2, sdy2}{Mean and SD of form Y for population 2.}

\item{mnv2, sdv2}{Mean and SD of anchor test V for population 2.}

\item{covyv2}{Covariance of Y and V for population 2.}

\item{w1}{Weight for population 1 in the synthetic population.}

\item{anchor}{Is the anchor internal (1) or external (0)?}

\item{mean_only}{A logical. If TRUE, mean equating is performed (slope fixed to 1).
If FALSE (default), linear equating is performed.}

\item{type}{A character vector specifying which methods to run. Can include
`"tucker"`, `"levine_observed"`, `"levine_true"`, `"chained"`. The default
`"all"` runs all four methods.}

\item{min_x, max_x, inc_x}{The score scale for form X.}
}
\value{
A list containing a `summary` data frame with coefficients for each
  method run, and an `equated_scores` data frame with the equated scores.
}
\description{
Computes linear equating for the CINEG design using specified methods:
Tucker, Levine Observed Score, Levine True Score, and/or Chained Linear. This is
an R translation of the `CI_LinEq` function.
