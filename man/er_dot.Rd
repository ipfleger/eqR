\title{Compute the Dot Product of Two Vectors}
\usage{
er_dot(vect1, vect2)

er_dot(vect1, vect2)
}
\arguments{
\item{vect1}{A numeric vector.}

\item{vect2}{A numeric vector of the same length as `vect1`.}
}
\value{
A single numeric value representing the dot product of the two vectors.

A single numeric value representing the dot product of the two vectors.
}
\description{
Computes the dot product of two numeric vectors. This is a wrapper around
R's highly efficient `crossprod()` function to maintain naming consistency
with the original C library (`er_dot`).

\details{
The original C function included an `offset` parameter to handle 0-based or
1-based indexing. This is not needed in R, as vector operations are
inherently 1-based and vectorized.
