\title{Solve a Lower Triangular System (Forward Substitution)}
\usage{
subfd(l, b)
}
\arguments{
\item{l}{A lower triangular numeric matrix.}

\item{b}{A numeric vector representing the right-hand side of the equation.}
}
\value{
A numeric vector `x` which is the solution to the system.
}
\description{
Solves the linear system `L %*% x = b` for `x`, where `L` is a lower
triangular matrix. This is an R equivalent of the `subfd` function.
}
\details{
This function is a wrapper for R's built-in `forwardsolve()` function,
which is optimized for this task. The C version modifies the `b` vector
in place, while this R function returns the solution vector `x`.
}
\examples{
L <- matrix(c(2, 0, 0, 6, 1, 0, -8, 5, 3), nrow = 3)
b <- c(4, 18, -2)
x <- subfd(L, b)
print(x) # Expected: c(2, 6, 8)
