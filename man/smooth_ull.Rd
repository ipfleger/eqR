\title{Perform Univariate Log-Linear Smoothing}
\usage{
smooth_ull(n, ns, min, inc, fd, c, scale = FALSE, crit = 1e-05, max_nit = 100)
}
\arguments{
\item{n}{An integer, the total number of examinees.}

\item{ns}{An integer, the number of score categories.}

\item{min}{A numeric value, the minimum score on the scale.}

\item{inc}{A numeric value, the increment between scores.}

\item{fd}{A numeric vector of the observed score frequencies.}

\item{c}{An integer, the degree of the polynomial to fit (e.g., c=3 for a
cubic model). This determines the number of moments to be matched.}

\item{scale}{A logical value. If TRUE, the columns of the design matrix
are centered and scaled, which can improve numerical stability.}

\item{crit}{A numeric value, the convergence criterion for the moments.}
}
\value{
A list containing the full results of the smoothing process,
  including the Beta coefficients, fitted frequencies (`mct`), number of
  iterations, chi-square statistics, moments, and the final smoothed
  density, CDF, and percentile ranks.
}
\description{
This is a high-level wrapper function that performs univariate log-linear
smoothing on a frequency distribution. It creates the design matrix, runs
the iterative fitting algorithm, and returns the smoothed distribution and
related statistics. This is an R translation of `Smooth_ULL`.
