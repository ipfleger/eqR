\title{Scale a Vector by a Constant}
\usage{
er_scale(vect, scale)
}
\arguments{
\item{vect}{A numeric vector to be scaled.}

\item{scale}{A single numeric value to scale the vector by.}
}
\value{
A new numeric vector containing the scaled values.
}
\description{
Performs the "scale" BLAS operation, which multiplies a vector by a scalar
value. It computes the expression `scale * x`.
}
\details{
This is a wrapper around R's standard vectorized arithmetic. The C version
(`er_scale`) modifies one of the input vectors in place. This R function
is designed to be more intuitive by taking the vector to be scaled as the
primary argument and returning a new vector with the result.

\examples{
v <- c(10, 20, 30)
s <- 0.5
er_scale(v, s) # Expected: c(5, 10, 15)
